# Scratch pad for elastic/elasticsearch-net

This is my personal scratch pad for running code against local checkouts of the .NET client for elasticsearch. Allows me to easily write a routine that can be run through BenchmarkDotNet and profiler.


The main repository also runs BenchmarkDotNet and profiler jobs in CI and indexes these into elasticsearch.

This repository is for doing quick one offs or to provide context for PR's
